# Rails Twitter Clone
I built this project to learn Ruby on Rails. I was interested in how Rails differed from other frameworks like Django for Python or Express for Node.js. This Rails project is a simplified Twitter clone. Tweets can be published, viewed, and commented on. Each user has a profile with their info and their tweets.


Work-in-progress as of 8/2/20. Live usable website to come.
